   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## How to Use

1. **Search for Characters**: Use the search bar at the top of the screen to type in the name of a character. The app will filter the list of characters based on your input.

2. **Manage Selected Characters**: You can select characters by tapping on them. Selected characters will be displayed below the search bar. To remove a character from the selected list, tap the "X" next to their name.
